# Anyware Software - Full-Stack Challenge

This is a full-stack application built for the Anyware Software challenge. It presents a student dashboard that displays announcements and quizzes for the current semester, fetches data from a custom-built backend API, and includes a complete set of tests.

---

### **Time Spent:** [_2 days_]

---

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
* React
* TypeScript
* Redux Toolkit
* React Router
* Material-UI (MUI)
* i18next (for translation readiness)
* Vitest & React Testing Library

**Backend:**
* Node.js
* Express.js
* TypeScript
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* tsyringe (for Dependency Injection)

---

## Features
* **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive and works on all screen sizes.
* **User Authentication:** A mock login/logout flow protects the dashboard page.
* **Live Data:** The frontend fetches all announcement and quiz data from the backend API.
* **Complete Backend API:** The backend provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for both announcements and quizzes.
* **Translation Ready:** The frontend is prepared for future translation using the i18n standard.
* **Tested:** The project includes both unit and integration tests to ensure code quality.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, you will need to run the backend and frontend servers in two separate terminals.

### Backend Setup
1.  Navigate to the `/backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Create a `.env` file in the `backend` root and add your MongoDB connection string:
    ```
    MONGO_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING
    ```
4.  Start the server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

### Frontend Setup
1.  Open a new terminal and navigate to the `/frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  Start the application:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Code Attribution
As per the project requirements, this section clarifies which code was generated by the project setup tools and which was written by me.

### Code Generated by Tools
The initial project structure and configuration files were generated by **Vite** (for the frontend) and `npm init` (for the backend). This includes:

* The initial versions of `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx`, and `index.css`.
* Configuration files like `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, and `package.json`.
* The `public` folder and the `index.html` file.

### Code Written by Me
All other code was written by me to fulfill the requirements of the challenge. This includes, but is not limited to:

* **Frontend:** All components, layouts, pages, Redux state management, routing, i18n setup, and tests.
* **Backend:** The entire server setup with Express, the database connection, all models, services, controllers, routes, and the Dependency Injection structure.
